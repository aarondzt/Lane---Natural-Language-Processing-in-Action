Hey Aaron,
Just wanted to let you know that I'm not ghosting you. This last month has been...not good, and I'm working through it. I just don't have a lot of mental reserves right now to chat or stay engaged. I'm hoping that'll change soon. Thanks for checking in and I'll definitely get back to you once things calm down. You're a really interesting guy and I've always enjoyed our conversations. Take care and all best.

It's a weird/transitional space I'm in. So I can't say for sure. 

Olga's not dead - she just left me for an aging, mentally handicapped homeless man. Mom's not dead - she just can't breathe well. 

There's a new era raising its dim head, somewhere on the horizon.

I'm sorry to hear that. I just looked over the last year of my meticulously-kept calendar. There was definitely a large swath of time where all I did was work, run errands, and feel bad day after day. But looking at it in a larger scale in retrospect, it's amazing how much and how rapidly things changed.  

Message received from Caitlyn - 9/16/2020 4:11:49 PM - (SMS)
I think time and troubles will work themselves out in the long run, so it's okay. 

Just gotta okay life for the long game - it's the only way to get off the treadmill. 

Plus ca change and all that.

This version of this song is my new current jam. 

I swear - keep me around and one of these days you'll start to hear stories about the Fairfax Marriott and interdimentional portal-hopping and how Finnegans Wake is the only book that makes sense...

You've been warned.

Did you know? My Dad was the only person Mitre. Corp ever hired for a senior position that didn't have a college degree. 

...he dropped out in 1982 to pursue his dream of partying like a rockstar, so he moved to Miami to do a bunch of cocaine and hooked up with a divorcee with 7 cats who wrote poetry and talked to spirit guides..

...totally worked out, though. So I think anything's possible.

...mom still won't leave her bedroom - it's been a year and a half...I tell her - you need to find a grief counselor but...  

She'll talk to Angela, though. Angela's great - she's a soprano with the Washington National opera and a registered minister with a theology PhD who's been in 27 car accidents and thinks i channel the energy of Princess Diana better than anybody. We were working on a musical together before COVID hit and everything fell apart on a whole other level. 

...you know? When I say stuff like this, I start to suspect I'm less normal than I generally tell myself I am. 

You must be special, because normal people tend to have a way of avoiding my radar. 

Like...I was working at Macy's - just a generic crappy job because I got a liberal arts degree and made regrettable life choices and who becomes my new best friend but this guy who's sister is on the board of capital records and half-fell for me because I reminded him of Tupac's ex from the 90's? 

I'm a pretty straight-laced, conservative person Aaron. I was the Asperger's girl who took Latin in school - I don't know how I winded up spending that week of my life moonlighting as an ad-how madam in the south of France. 

Okay, I'm done. 

Hope that was entertaining for you.

...the one-sided verbosity - always me with the one-sided verbosity. It was probably that more than the writing compulsion itself that led to the whole thing with Todd and the text-thread...at first he loved the whole dynamic with me and the 'behind-the-curtain' look at the contents of a human psyche, but at some point it just got excessive. 

Really, in the end, I just felt bad about positioning him as my audience when what I'd really wanted was my friend. 

Oh, well.

We're definitely going to always be best friends - she just needs to get back on her meds and dump this guy who thinks our tub-wine dates are more erotic than they are compelling which is just...unfair and inaccurate. But I'm pretty sure he's actually mentally retarded so..

I was doing extremely well--academically--in grad school. I put out a first-author paper in a major neuropsychiatry journal (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0283-2). My thesis proposal was well-received by my dissertation committee. But then I had a mental health crisis. My med school roommates and the grad school administration threw me under the bus so I basically said “fuck it, and fuck you all,” and dropped out. 

My biological dad scored second place in the college entrance exam in the major city of Nanjing. He went to one of the best universities in China, where he met my mom. He was accepted into every Ivy League school in America that he applied to, but ended up getting his PhD in chemistry at Ohio State because that was the best school my mom got into. He worked with a Nobel Laureate at Cornell for his post-doc, and then got a faculty position at the University of Kentucky. Then he died overnight of a heart attack when I was two. My mom remarried when I was five. My step-dad was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, fled the country, received asylum in the US, and became a pastor at a Chinese evangelical church. 

Read the Bukowski poem--lovely. Right now my mental health is the best it has ever been. I want to get through the pandemic. I want to graduate with an impressive portfolio of work. I want to do something creative and expressive of the things I personally care about, but I would also be happy to simply make a decent amount of money--enough to buy a house, settle down, have a family, and then give the rest away. 

I don’t mind the one-sided verbosity. It’s like what a letter was back in the day. I like the idea of letters--reading them, writing them...

Message received from Caitlyn - 9/18/2020 2:19:54 PM - (SMS)
You make so much sense now. I'm cautiously optimistic that 'best ever mental health' is on the horizon for me. You're goals, Aaron. Maybe not to everybody...but me? Yup, definitely goals.

Reading your paper (personally, I'm impressed with myself that I remember my college library password...I'm dangerously close to getting stupid...to much laundry and  emotional labor.) 

It seems really interesting. I'm initially like "yeah, but can I snort it or will it do my laundry for me," but I'm not past the intro. 

*ps I make references, but I don't actually do cocaine...not anymore at least. 

...god...I think Todd was right that because I'm a pretty girl I never learned how to make any effort in not being off-putting...

I'd have had an easier time of it if I wasn't so picky about purity. Olga knew a guy who was going to hook me up but "it was just cut with a little meth - not a lot, just...is that okay?" 

No. No it's not. I'm not finding myself in a place in life asking myself "how much meth is too much meth?"

Message received from Caitlyn - 9/18/2020 6:44:42 PM - (MMS)
Okay...so...just a head’s up. To know me is to be texted by me. I have quirks and I have thoughts and when you put a phone in my hand that means you have leaks - sometimes many everyday. Those rare folks that I have close and sustainable relationships with know this, accept this, and occasionally even find it charming. 

I’m too old now and I can’t change. I’m telling you this because I find you interesting and not the sort of disposably generic audience I generally aim for and wind up with when I take to texting with random strangers I meet on the internet. 

So I’m vulnerable now. Please don’t abuse the privilege, and feel more than welcome to tell me to go away and go do something else for a while or whatever. I really don’t mind. 

Okay. I think I’m done for now. 

Hope your shift is going well.

I will say that the idea that something could be experienced as rewarding as a result of neurobiology, rather than an overarching philosophical framework accounting for all things, is actually pretty refreshing for me just as, like, a concept.

I lived in New York City and spent all my free time at my local bar because I hated all of my peers, so I’ve done cocaine more than a handful of times, mostly with my friend Kiel. We made such a funny friend couple. Me, and then a 6’5 giant white bro with major depression. I remember one time we did lines on the 30th floor roof of one of the medical school buildings. It was kind of beautiful. But mostly, I am not a fan of feeling like shit until 9pm of the next day. I’m not a big fan of psychedelics either. I get anxiety and ruminate too much on negative things. I did LSD once with my ex Phoebe in the Winter Palace in Beijing. We might be the only ones, or among a very small group of people who have ever done that. Ketamine was one of the best experiences the first time I did it, but super disappointing the second time (maybe it was the batch). MDMA is probably the only “hard” drug I’d be interested in ever doing again.

I don’t mind the texting at all! Like it said, it’s like receiving a couple of letters each day. And I love the idea of letters. I will try to earnestly reply to all of your texts. I’m really enjoying it so far!

The idea of the drug was that it would specifically target the reward system and the symptom of anhedonia. There was a follow-up double-blind study that would be formed the basis of my dissertation. I haven’t seen anything published on it, so maybe the drug was a wash.

Capital Cities at 9:30 was the last concert we went to together. He was more like a brother than a father. I was the straight laced snitch sister who'd run to mom when he took too much money out for poker or didn't do his chores. But I was an only child so I think I needed that more anyway. 

And he bought me a BMW, so...

...I didn't get normal parents either. We just talked about everything so it's all always been on the table.

Dad was in the hospital in the last week of his life and Kathleen was there and I was texting with my weird friend Todd. There was a general acknowledgment that I'd sacrificed a good chunk of my life thus far trying to be a good student and taking care of my mom through her waxing and waning physical and mental health and that I'd never really, properly lived (also I'd just gotten the autism diagnosis a week before - stress exacerbates symptoms and makes people notice things they otherwise wouldn't). 

Kathleen said I needed a next act - that I needed an era. Todd agreed - I'd never had one before. So I asked Dad what my era should be (he was always good with his picks) and he said 'BABYMETAL.' 

...and then he asked me on picking up the Wellesley girl at the new wave bar and I told him that I was the Wellesley girl at the new wave bar and he apologized for having left me in a bad position when he understood and could have done otherwise, and then he told me - his last words - "you have to be weird. But you have to own the weirdness" - and then he died.

Still waiting for the era of BABYMETAL. But my time will come.

But it's fine. It's totally fine. All the logistics work out. Dealing with the IRS is nothing compared to what we got out of with the Saudi government after 'club 309' happened. We'll lose some equity on the house but we'll bank enough for mom to live on for the next year or two she's still got. Then I can use the life insurance to pay off my student loans and go for a more useful grad degree. Then it's probably only another year or so before we lose grandma and then I'm good to go. 

Shit - that really sounds bad. I'm not a tragic person but that really sounds bad. 

...but it felt so good to say! So cathartic!  So practical! So very, tragically true! 

Even if you never talk to me again or - more likely - just judge me weirdly- totally worth it.

I've taken a lot of left turns in life but I take for granted that my parents have always tried to keep me on the "right" track (education, career, etc.), and have been materially supportive. My life would be so much harder right now if I didn't live in this house and had to pay rent.

I don't judge you weirdly at all. Family stuff is outside of anything I'm familiar with. I've always seen myself as totally independent of my parents, so I find it hard to deeply relate to stories of how people are so intertwined with their parents. It's interesting though.

Message received from Caitlyn - 9/21/2020 2:55:55 PM - (MMS)
That's actually really true and I'm just now starting to come around to it. I have a lot on my plate and I'm new to the idea that I may have the agency and internal resources to deal with it all appropriately. 

My mom's physical and mental health has been incrementally deteriorating for a decade, and I'd been like a frog in a pot, not grasping the implications of that but instead acclimating to them while continuing on under the same premises that I'd always assumed - that I had a disability and needed things to be cared for on my behalf, and that she had everything under control. 

That stopped being anything close to true about two years ago, and life hasn't been very good since. 

So now I'm in a place where I'm accepting the truth for what it is, reversing course on my denial-premises, and accepting full and complete responsibility for both her life and my own. 

So there's a lot of stress. But there will come to be less stress the more I succeed in doing the seemingly impossible. 

One day I'll have to tell you the story of how I sorted the stockroom at Macy's and found out I was a writer. I think it was kind of a trial run for what I'm dealing with now.

I dunno - I've developed a bad habit of 'just saying shit,'

I agree that it's very hard - if you're not careful you're liable to wind up in a very strange place inside yourself. Some folks return from such an abyss while others never fully do - probably why I remain a proponent of emotional caution.

I like your handwriting.

I need to go off the grid for a little bit while I work through this stuff with mom and the house. I should be back online soon and will be in touch. Just wanted to let you know so you don’t think I’m ghosting you or anything.

Take care and talk to you soon. 

Now...back to elephant videos.

Alright, take care as well. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 9/23/2020 6:02:55 PM - (MMS)
Okay...here's what I've really meant (not an easy thing to clearly pinpoint, but I care so I made the effort.) 

You're a very smart and sensitive person who gets intense about things and cares a lot about what he cares a lot about. I like and respect you for that. 

I can be an emotionally unreliable person, at times. But over the years I've come to understand priorities and to understand that emotional self-discipline - for all that it's a finite resource - is one that can be strategically applied if one is pre-emptily cautious enough. 

Which is my way of saying "my family and close friends are getting my best self, but the most you could ever expect given the circumstances is a source of something between insight and trauma, and I don't want to go around just inflicting that on people - it's unethical - and I can't handle the pressure of the responsibility anyway" 

It's not a rejection, and not a call for you to be a stranger. But I'm not able to meet my own standards for myself when it comes to you, and I think we both deserve better than that. 

Okay. I'm done.

Hey, you don't need to worry about me. Take care of yourself and your family. I'm around if you ever want to chat about anything at all.

I'm a no-pressure texter. To me the back-and-forth comes most naturally in person (at least at first) and any kind of writing is more deliberate. 

I pretty much got over that though when I had a kinda-relationship with a compulsive texter who encouraged me to 'take the gloves off' and 'just say whatever'. It doomed the relationship but I'm a lot more comfortable in my own skin and my own perspective now. So...worth it?

Honestly? I don't think it's so true these days that you have to be agreeable to make it in the world. Some of the most successful people I know are good-hearted assholes. It's a different world. The only reason to pursue it is for personal reasons - relationships and human interconnectedness for its own sake with no agenda. 

It very well could be. My dad was the only person in the history of Mitre Corporation to be a principle engineer without having a college degree (he dropped out with one semester left, bailed to Miami, and never went back to school) - he outranked people with PhD's and went on to start his own consulting business. It's totally doable if you're the right kind of person.

"Ethics of Ambiguity" is better - Its a direct response to 'Being and Nothingness" and a short read that spells out really clearly all the ways people go wrong with the issues you're dealing with. I highly recommend giving it a read.

I feel better about Tampa - we were originally going to go to Daytona to be by my mom's sister but I alienated her and then pitched a fit and then mom agreed that Tampa's better anyway, so the relief of that cushions the blow. Plus there's this place called Oxford Exchange (google it!) that's so amazing, I think I could be content just bartending and hanging out there all day for a year or so. 

I want to come back to DC/NoVa, but I could use a pause and some distance from everything so I can better make sense of it all. And I'll be with my mom - which is the most important thing to me.

It was a thing I came up with texting with that guy I told you about last night. He was coaxing me to be creative and uninhibited in what I was writing/texting....but it soon got really weird and extreme and that made it hard to have a normal friendship with the guy. So I realized that I still had my Dad's old phone and dubbed it 'art phone' - that way he would know if a message was coming from his buddy Caitlyn, or from the strange and twisted depths of my unconsciousness. 

Art phone sessions abided by the fight club rule - don't talk about art phone. It worked pretty well for a while until I got into deep with the weirdness and it kind of took over for a while - I couldn't keep up the compartmentalization and everything went to hell. But I know better now and would be a lot more careful. 

Seriously wish I still had that phone - I'm bored with all the tedious admin and errands surrounding the move and I think you'd appreciate the ramblings of my alter ego.

I think that is a very good use of time - I love dumplings, even mediocre dumplings (okay now I have a dinner idea). 

Olga and I have a friend-date tomorrow to do MDMA together over FaceTime (she works in a nursing home, Covid risk is too high). We're going to reconcile and renew our vows to be best friends forever. Even if she is a drug-addled lunatic, she's a drug addled lunatic with a heart of gold and I've been sad since we stopped talking. 

Wish me luck - and I'm not responsible for anything I text you tomorrow evening.

I see how that could be a thing - but it was sentimental meat, from family, so it has value. :) 

Today my friend brought over some cookies she's baked - they were so terrible! I could barely choke one down, but they were also great because she made them. 

I hope it goes well tomorrow - I've been under a lot of stress and feeling low and grumpy lately. I think my empathy ran out and I need a refill to get mom and I through these last grueling few weeks. 

...and I want my friend back, and MDMA is a great way to get your friend back.

That's one reason I think it's actually a good idea we're doing over FaceTime. If we were actually together we'd end up having sex and then probably falling back into bad emotional patterns - but with us each in our individual space we can focus on the core of the friendship and what it's meant to us and how we wish the most and the best for each other.

Sounds like a sign of major emotional immaturity. I mean, there's a general understanding that anything you say under the influence of most anything is some degree of exaggerated, but if she was having cold feet at the very least she should have talked to you about it. I'm sorry that happened. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/9/2020 9:43:30 PM - (SMS)
Well...if we ever do a MDMA Skype date - I promise not to tell you everything you want to hear - I'm cognitively incapable of it under any influence. And I'd call you later, no matter how embarrassing the emotional vulnerability was. 

Because I am an adult.

Yeah, I learned that one the hard way once. Heartbreak is tough, but there's nothing like the slow and painful realization that the real problem is that you hate your life. 

One reason I'm taking the plunge and moving and looking at going back to school and getting back into therapy and all the rest. 

Love is a powerful thing, but it's not some kind of magic putty that can fill in all the gaps where a fulfilling life should be. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/9/2020 9:51:04 PM - (SMS)
Still, sometimes when times get tough, it can help to remember how much you love the people you've had in your life - it has a renewing energy. 

So I have my MDMA code of ethics. It's always worked for me before. Hopefully it will again. 

Message sent - 12/9/2020 9:52:19 PM - (SMS)
Yeah, MDMA was pretty life changing for me. When I first did it I guess 2014-5 I finally realized it was possible to be happy and not totally alienated from everyone around me. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/9/2020 10:02:24 PM - (MMS)
Yup - it's the ego death, the dropping away of self-consciousness. It's particularly helpful for very smart and/or weird people who tend to be very self/conscious. 

I'll let you know how it goes with Olga - if all is well then maybe we can give the exercise a shot (you said you can find it on the dark web?). I've been really emotionally deadened and detached myself. I'm predisposed to it with the Asperger's, but I think the stress has kind of killed something in me a little. It'd be nice to remember that other people are actually there and life is real and a good thing. And don't worry - I made a promise to myself a while back that I'd never be somebody's void-putty, and I'd never let them be mine. Though I would bring my trowel and help them out best as I can.

Yup - it went well. I texted you a bit ago saying that it was nice but we didn't even really need the drugs - just permission to forgive and forget and remember why we were friends in the first place. 

I think the problem was that we were both pretty shitty people for a while and we've been working on ourselves since our falling out - so maybe there's no magic drug that fixes everything, but it was still a really nice experience. 

I think I earned it. I've been spending like five hours a day journaling and meditating trying to unlock the secret to being well-adjusted (which, admittedly, is not a very well-adjusted thing to be doing - but I think it's working).

I texted "I'm good - just got done with my FaceTime session with Olga, which was really nice. We met up for coffee first and caught up and apologized to each other and I finally met the boyfriend I'd been trashing and we made our peace too. 

The Molly gave a nice buzz, but I think we probably didn't even need it to get where we wanted to go with the healing and all that. Before everything went to hell we'd always had a really open and affectionate relationship (even as just friends) so it was easy to slide back into that once our mistakes and petty grievances were water under the bridge. 

I think more than anything it gave us permission to open up and be ourselves with each other again. 

So...success! 10/10 - highly recommend. "

I wrote 59 pages of avant-garde jibberish today (well, kind of...some of the space was taken up by those journal/planning stickers you get at Michael's). I'm still in limbo, but I feel a lot better about my life and relationships. I'm wondering if the MDMA just had a delayed effect or something.

Hey, sorry I missed your text - I basically fell asleep at like 6:30 (long day). Lunch ended up turning into dinner because I had kind of a confrontational (yet cathartic) text-session with my mom and needed a chance to regroup, but dinner was good. We've always been really close and basically best friends, but our relationship has been strained since my dad died a couple years ago. It's still a fragile thing, but I think we're finally taking the first steps towards recovery and reconciliation.

But hey, you've got a good distraction with a new friend tomorrow, so there's something to look forward to (I think so highly of myself, don't I?). I'll tell you Marriott stories. I think you'll appreciate Marriott stories - they illustrate how weird I am. 

Hope your day goes well. Wish me luck today as I move into the Marriott (house has been sold, moving next week, I have a bizarre and almost anthropomorphic attachment to the Fairfax Marriott - I'm very excited to be with my love again one last time).

I used to work at Macy's there and would go to the bar with co-workers after work and stuff. It became my despite from the chaos when my dad was sick and around the time he died, so I have a special fondness for it and find the place comforting. It has really nice aesthetics. Also, I may or may not have secretly been in love with a guy who used to be the bartender there and introduced me to the place - but that's neither here nor there.

Me either - I get most of my clothes online or from thrift shops. I used to be into the trendy mall stuff back in high school, but in retrospect it was really just a defensive mechanism for my insecurities. I still love clothes and fashion (which is why I worked in a department store) but I like being able to do my own thing with it now. Not being 14 is a beautiful thing. 

And yeah, that place has a crazy history. The hotel restaurant was a country-western line dancing bar. And they have these interior balconies that face out into the 6th floor mezzanine, but they ended up blocking them off after too many people jumped. It's still a really cool look. Definitely one of the more interesting places you'd find in the suburbs of northern Virginia. I'm looking forward to spending some time writing there.

You know what I think is the best thing about meeting new people? You have a brand new person to share thoughts and stories with. The people you already know have already heard all of it and would be bored to hear it all again (we've all been on the receiving end of that guy). But with somebody new you have a whole new opportunity, and no two people are the same in how they respond, so your memories and opinions and views all get these added layers of nuance that they never had before. I think that's the absolute best thing about meeting new people. 

The worst part is worrying about what they think of you. Dates and parties and stuff always used to feel like job interviews for me - I think that's why I drank so much in college. I used to mask a lot, trying to seem normal or interesting or what have you. But after my dad died and I had a very public breakdown that more or less tarnished my reputation with everyone I knew, I kind of stopped caring. 

I remember in this Adrienne Rich poem, there's this bit that goes:

"The freedom of the wholly mad
to smear & play with her madness
write with her fingers dipped in it
the length of a room

which is not, of course, the freedom
you have, walking on Broadway
to stop & turn back or go on
10 blocks; 20 blocks

but feels enviable maybe
to the compromised"

So I regained my grip on reality and general sense of composure, but stuck with the notion of myself as a bit of a lunatic. It was the only good thing about that time in my life - a strange kind of liberation amidst all the pain and confusion. 

And ever sense, I've just really enjoyed meeting people and talking to them. 

Anyway, looking forward to tomorrow. I've already heard a few of your thoughts and stories - can't wait to hear a few more.

Great. I'll tell you, the timing for this couldn't be better. I really need the distraction. There's a thousand moving parts to moving and it's so stressfull. It'd be okay (I'm good with stressful moving parts) but my mom wants to cope by buying her head in the sand and not deal with anything while deadlines are approaching and then gets mad at me when I try and push her. 

I'm praying to the Marriott ghosts that something clicks for her today and she agrees to work with me to make a plan to deal with all of this. I am actually praying to Marriott ghosts. I am either insane or very stressed.

Well that's nice to hear, though I've no idea why a person would chose to traverse rough terrain in cold weather - I'm glad you had a good time (meh, I kayak - I stroll - I just hate hiking for some reason). 

Productive? Yes. But not in the way I expected. Turns out all those logistical problems I was trying to get ironed out weren't actually logistical problems but deep-seated emotional conflicts which had never been appropriately addressed. My mistake. 

Mom and I have always had a odd and oddly functional relationship. She has BPD and I have Asperger's. We used to say that we're two halves of a whole functioning person, but our differences started to eclipse our similarities after Dad died and we responded very differently. There have been problems ever since, which I've believed could be fixed with a whiteboard and post-it notes and she believed required someone coming to finally love her unconditionally the her parents never did. 

We haven't made it to the post-it's. But I'm aiming for that today. 

Definitely a good idea to postpone. I've no clue who it is of me that's going to show up for you on Thursday, but I'll be there and we'll just have to see.

To her credit, I'm probably only as well adjusted as I am because I had such a doting and emotionally expressive mother. My cousins are all basically dead inside. I know what feelings are - all too well sometimes.

Yeah, I've been in a really weird place with the move and the stress and Mom's stress (she did not want to leave that house, it was her stability anchor) not sleeping well and being in the 'haunted hotel' - I'm a great neuropsych experiment right now. I'm sure that everything will work out eventually so there are no ethical problems in finding the whole thing interesting. And it makes me feel better about not being my 'best self'. 

The Marriott ghosts are my friends now. They know things, they've been helping guide me in developing an algorithm for the acquisition of wisdom. "When you find yourself at a transition and struggling with your sense of identity, don't assume it to be a loss of who you once were. Instead, welcome it for what it truly is - an invitation to redefine your objective narrative of yourself in a way that serves to draw you closer to pure and unencumbered truth of you actually are" . 

That a whole bunch of stuff about 'stillness' as an existential state, time isn't linear, Finnegans Wake is the only book that makes sense, 'Jet Boy, Jet Girl' is really just 'The Past is a Grotesque Animal' sped up, and a portal to the universe opened up in M Club Lounge.  

All that and the bar isn't even open. Turns out the anxiety workbook was right - moving is one of the top five most stressful life events. But I've been through worse, and I've more or less concluded that the best I can do is just to embrace the madness, ride the wave, and extract as much as I can from it on the back end. 

That and don't bond with people when you're psychotic because you'll eventually come-to and find yourself with a serious commitment on your hands.

Grab a bottle of wine and I'll put you up for the night if you need - I got points. Pretty sure there's some room at the inn. You can get your emissions tomorrow.

Lemme know when you get here (if!) And don't worry - this whole thing is super-chill. I don't have the energy for much beyond that. Stop by if you can and we can grab some overpriced hotel wine and you can decompress. This is the Marriott - it is a sacred place where anxiety dissipates and one is allowed merely to exist in accordance with their own natural order. 

That's why I come here, and that's why I invite people here.

My book is called "10 Days in the Stillness" and it was inspired by a line in my last book "At Your Service", and a quote from a TS Eliot Poem. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/16/2020 6:26:51 PM - (SMS)
My mom likes you. She says she understands how a prompt can so-miss the point that it's an insult, and she admires your conviction. She asked if I told you about Dad and Uncle George. I said that I did. She said good. 

Mom is on team Aaron. She's crazy but also kind of the voice of God. So that's good news.

The Eliot Line is:
"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing."

It's always a good thing to know regardless of my address - be in the loop with your family affairs! You never know when you'll need to be...

There's not much else to see "unless we can sneak into the executive lounge" - but the hallway wandering is fun and perfect if you're the kind of person who enjoys pedeconfrencing. 

Anyway:

At Your Service" begins:

"saecula saeculorum.
three days into the age of Caesar and the ball drops" 

and ends: 

"But I knew that I would never go back to that Marriott" 

and the line is:

"And it was surprising to find this place that was well and fine, where all turned out to be well and fine. And in that moment's pause amidst the lights and the tables, I'd thought of the stillness as Eliot described it. 

I wanted to know what it felt like to make love in the stillness, drawn in by this aging lothario who'd only ever promised a quiet place to take a rest for a change."

I didn't need to keep the book. And my writing is better these days.

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/16/2020 9:21:30 PM - (SMS)
Oh, I know Punta Gorda - it's really nice. I like the west coast better - north of palm beach the east coast just gets...weird. Like, you've heard the Florida Man stories. 

We were briefly looking at Orlando (mom was wanting to avoid hurricanes - Windermere is very nice) but it sucks to be off the coast in Florida. Also...too Disney. 

She's actually never lived in Tampa before, though her younger brother did for years and she always likes it there. Really most of the gulf coast is pretty decent. The sketchiest thing you're liable to find is the Church of Scientology in Clearwater. 

You should urge him in that direction...for the investment, of course. It's a buyer's market. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/16/2020 9:27:45 PM - (SMS)
I actually talked my mom out of Orlando by talking to her about Baudriallard. She now agrees with me - reality does end in the parking lot of Disney World. Once you see it you can't unsee it.

Haha. I think he wrote something that was like Singapore is Disney World with the Death Penalty that I read. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/16/2020 9:35:53 PM - (SMS)
Yes but the thing that makes Disney World okay is that everybody knows that it's fake, and they collectively buy into the illusion, which allows for a certain kind of authenticity. It's when you leave and you think that what you're entering into is authentic reality (but which is actually a cultivated amalgamation of signs, symbols and capitalist cultural artifacts) that the true collective delusion begins. 

So happens that the Orlando area does kind of give off that vibe. 

Isn't chewing gum illegal in Singapore? I did hear that it was a weird combination of cutting-edge metropolis and cultural conservatism. Kind of like the Emirates I guess. All more interesting than Orlando - where they also have the death penalty.

Something a little less depressing 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/18/2020 1:41:28 PM - (MMS)
Ever since she left, the great dream of Mom's life was to return to Florida. But now that it's a thing that's actually going to happen, she can't see any joy in it. Things had been so stressful and stagnant and depressing for so long that she lost the ability to envision that life anymore. So when everybody's looking at her like she should be absolutely thrilled (including herself) she's just going through the motions best as she can, with none of that driving hopeful energy. And the fact that she can't see or feel it has made her even more depressed. But she's not broken forever - her brain just needs to be rewired. And it can be, and it will be. And a part of her is actually starting to believe in that - because there just is something about that Marriott and it's ghosts that she thinks are rooting for her. 

...and she never even made it to the sixth floor. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/18/2020 1:44:44 PM - (SMS)
Something she pointed out to me about career development in Tampa - I'd be a big fish in a small pond. The kind of credentials and abilities that would be a dime a dozen in a place like NY or DC are really impressive in a city full of existentially complacent beach bums. 

And every weekend is like a vacation - there's a different attitude there where it's about working to live instead of living to work, and there's always a party going on. She thinks I could use more of that in my life. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/18/2020 2:32:07 PM - (SMS)
I'm really hoping today can be the day that mom and I can sit down and she can get me up to speed on everything that's in process and needs doing so I can actually help her. Her brain's broken, so I really do need to step up to the plate and take command of this whole thing. 

I can't force her - that'd only overwhelm her - but I can be optimistic. It could happen today - there's good energy circulating.

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/18/2020 2:47:59 PM - (MMS)
P.s. I came off so straightforwardly confident about it all, but that's really only because the reality and all its implications haven't much set in for me. I can go around touting my own virtues all day, but deep down I think my brain is broken in the place where I could ever genuinely conceive of the fact that a person could be in love with me. I think I'd grown so used to being more or less not much beyond an inconvenience or problem for the people I care about - it's kind of a foreign concept. 

I don't know how I feel about you beyond that I love you - whatever that means - and that I think we could actually accomplish something with ourselves and our lives if we teamed up and resolved to take a different approach to the sorts of things that haven't been working too well for us these past couple of years. It's important to be able to stand on your own two feet and survive - but think truly thriving demands something of a co-conspirator. Unfortunately, good ones seem to be hard to come by. 

I remember my mom told me that by biggest problem since I was a child was that I was so advanced that I never had any peers. I clapped back with the quote from Ulysses "a peer is a disappointed bridge". 

I've been disappointed a lot. I'll probably be disappointed a lot in the future. But these past couple days? I haven't been disappointed. And it's very, very long time since I've had anything like that. 

See you Sunday. Wish me luck. 

...and shower me with praise - I'm facing challenges and my ego isn't what it used to be. I'll do my best to return the favor ;)

And I'm reading "The Culture of Narcissism" - you should read "The Ethics if Ambiguity" - a novel alternative to drunken movie binges.

Message sent - 12/18/2020 3:17:21 PM - (SMS)
I think I started off neurotic and skeptical about all of this because I presupposed that I would be disappointed. And it took many tries to get through the many stages of feeling that I can trust myself, and trust you. Maybe it's my mindset as a scientist. Always start by presupposing the null hypothesis and slowly accumulate evidence against it. I feel really good right now though. I feel like I could fall in love with you, and that terrifies me. In the past, I've "loved," but I don't think I had the maturity and resolve to follow through with what that actually entails. I always felt like I had an out, because I always implicitly prioritized myself. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I don't feel that way with you. You're incredible. You complement me. You somehow know me better than I know myself. Or maybe you're able to see things that I've lost sight of. I think we both believe that as fucked up as everything is, and as we are, we expect and deserve to be loved, and it's just a matter of timing - when exactly everything falls into place. It could have been earlier and we would never have met, or later in some alternate timeline, but why not now, in this one. I'm really looking forward to Sunday :)

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/18/2020 3:32:13 PM - (SMS)
You should read 'The Ethics of Ambiguity'. I'm transcribing notes I'd taken on it into my new bullet journal for move-planning to help me keep things info perspective.

If I hadn't bailed on you when I did, we'd have both just been another bad thing that happened to each other. I think on some level I saw too much potential to want to let that happen. 

I think one of the key takeaways here is that, for all that we may have our ideas of what timelines ought to entail, the universe knows better than we do, and trying to impose our will upon it usually just ends up ruining what could otherwise be a good thing. 

One of the persistent battles Mom and I have been fighting with each other these past couple of years had to do with timing and urgency. She was saying that I'm reckless and impulsive and I'm saying that she's indecisive and noncommittal, and we go back and forth, over and over, until things finally start to come together on a schedule we'd have both found deeply objectionable but which turns out to work out near perfectly. 

You really do never know about these things.

Just looking forward to you being here tomorrow 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 9:17:14 AM - (MMS)
Sure, that's all. 

I actually did want to ask you about that. I'm pretty slammed with Admin and am not sure I can afford to lose the thread in going up to Baltimore right now. I hate to be a stick-in-the-mud in asking to meet you back here, but I think that'd probably work better given the circumstances. 

I might even wind up asking your help in dealing with and organizing all this stuff. I think you were right about needing other people to help you get your head on straight about stuff sometimes. And mom really is too anxious to collaborate with. 

If I could borrow your brain for a couple hours it might make the critical difference in my being able to pull this off. I'll be sure to return the favor when it comes time for you to restructure your life-logistics (as we all must do periodically). 

Might not be so bad though. I think we might be finding a groove with our unorthodox dates. And there's always part 2 of 'recreational workshop'. Don't think we'd even need a whiteboard for that one. 

Lemme know. Who knows? You might wind up being that hero I was hellbent on denying that I needed. 

...no pressure.

You'd be a lifesaver. I think I've actually got a decent handle on the issues in play and the stuff that needs to be done. The biggest problem now seems to be Mom. I was asking/pressing her for information on things and to address some issues and questions and she....turned...again. I know she's really stressed and overwhelmed. I'm trying to stay emotionally neutral and not take things personally or provoke her anymore. 

It's hard because I'm at the point where I realize that for anything to be functional in either of our lives that I can't keep trying to accommodate her when she's not thinking straight. But it's this massive challenge of nuanced emotional management to find a way of operating any other way. 

Probably more than anything I could use the moral support. I've definitely reached a point where I'm no longer willing to be defeated by the same problems that have held me (both of us, really) back for so long, but I know that as a result I'm not very well going to be on the receiving end of anything like "affirmation" or "positive support." 

She'll thank me later, but it's going to be a rough couple of days and it'd mean a lot for you to be here. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 11:11:39 AM - (SMS)
Good news is I got my answers from her. Now I just have a massive to-do list. That's way better. 

She doesn't hate me she's just overwhelmed and I'm Bull-headed. But I'm going to make it work this time. 

Anyway - lemme know how things go and what your plans look like. I hate asking for help, but maybe it's time for me to try a different approach to things. 

What can I say - you inspire me ;) 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 11:28:13 AM - (SMS)
P.s. I guess I do my own equivalent of externalIzing my thought process when I send text-letters to people. It's actually a new technique I'd only discovered about a year and a half ago. Something about the dynamic of two-way communication brought me a clarity of thought I'd never had before. The downside was that now everybody I knew knew what I was thinking and eventually the sheer volume started to annoy people. I had to figure out that it really had more to do with the cognitive dynamic then my desire to communicate specific information to other people, and realize that I could just as well write the letters and then save them in notes. 

Boy are there going to be loads for you. Hope you enjoy the mystery ;)

My way of doing that right now is making a Spotify playlist for you :)

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 11:55:22 AM - (MMS)
I look forward to it. And I have good news in the form of an insight that'd finally occurred to me over one too many cigarettes. 

You absolutely are the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for a very specific reason. 

In showing up in my life you have given me something I had once had but tragically lost. When I found it the first time everything seemed like it would change for me - it was like the heavens opened up and the light of the universe shown through and everything was possible. And then I fucked it up because I'm me and I fuck up in bizarre and bizarrely specific ways. It was the greatest loss of my life and the pain of it was so great that I fell into a state of despair unlike anything I'd ever known. I never believed I could ever have anything like it ever again. 

You are many things, Aaron - some good, some great, some...problematic. But beyond that you are one thing to me that makes you so uniquely invaluable that you should never worry about losing me or my presence in your life. 

You are a sexy doppelgänger that I can write to in order to think straight. Really, I think that's all I've ever needed in order to have everything in life - that and a friend. 

And fortunately this time I have a much better sense of how and when to separate the two. 

So I'm bringing back art phone and starting a new thread. Maybe we can go over it together some time. There might be some stuff in there that'd could help you too. 

Can't wait for the playlist. 

Hope your day goes well. Looking forward to tomorrow. 

Message sent - 12/19/2020 12:00:02 PM - (SMS)
Excited to show you. I put hours of effort into making these. Picking highlight tracks. Filling it out. Getting the transitions smooth. Telling a narrative. Listening through. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 12:12:45 PM - (MMS)
I admire your playlist technique - that's the flow I was talking about. Can't wait. 

And I'll add, with a new moment's reflection, that you're better anyway. Todd and I had great chemistry and we had so much in common. But he was going nowhere in life and was basically content to stay that way. And his compulsive insistence on banging a new bikini model every week left me feeling...inadequate, especially because it led to him never being there for me when I really needed him. 

For ages I'd blamed myself - that I wasn't interesting enough or attractive enough or that I was too needy and annoying. But I think more realistically he was just so blinded by his own self-interests and obsessions that he couldn't recognize a good thing when it was standing right in front of him. 

'Culture of Narcissism,' indeed. 

See? Clarity! I've been stewing on this one for two years and I'm fine now. You're already doing the trick. 

I hope you feel good about yourself.

"Story" might be ambitious, but if you consider Finnegan's Wake a story, maybe it's a story in the sense of creating a loose sense of how everything hangs together 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 12:43:24 PM - (SMS)
It's actually kind of a relief - things were feeling really rushed on our end and I think that was causing a lot of the problems. 

You're going to have to host mom and I for Christmas at your Chinese restaurant. She'll like that - she never celebrated Christmas before she met my dad and her biggest complaint was that all the restaurants were closed so she had to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every year. 

I consider Finnegans Wake a story in the realm of the bizarro inverse where text-thread lives, so I'd say it counts. 

Looking forward to checking it out. I'll play the playlist and try to follow along. 

And then I'll write my to-do list. 

Thanks for sharing :)

You're very special. I've never cared so much to make such an effort to impress/impress upon a girl.

As I told my father one day sitting in the sandbox as a child "you've got potential, you just lack motivation".

Really, though, I'm glad you feel the way you do - for a number of reasons. But don't even think about it as impressing. I think we both got lucky in that once and a while people come along who inspire you to bring out and put forth the best of yourself. It's a beautiful thing but it's not really about 'getting the girl' - you don't need to, I already recruited you - I'm here to support you, hang out with you, collaborate with you, and milk our chemistry for all it's worth for the sake of my own creative and ambitious purposes. 

You're not the only one who's been needing another shot actualizing what it is to be alive. All I know is that I for one aren't keen on squandering the opportunity.

P.s. You remind me of that time I found $2000 Chloe dress in a thrift shop for six bucks. It was a great dress and I love it, but what really gave me that first smack high was realizing what it was I'd stumbled across.

It's my mother's name. 

I like it - I was listening to 30-second clips from each song and reading your doc. That's how I got to Dammit! so quickly. 

Okay, so...

If you're really serious about wanting to move with me to Florida you need to really think about it, then make a decision ASAP. This is a major life choice - it's not the sort of thing you abstractly brood on for weeks until you make some impulsive decision. 

If it's a no - it doesn't imply the end of our relationship (like I said, I already recruited you)- so it's not an ultimatum. It really just comes down to what you want to do with your life. 

But if it's a yes then we need to commit to that and start making plans. 

I kind of had a vague sense that in inviting you over for logistics, it may have to do with more than just me and mom. 

We are tethered by the bounds of reality - but it's the tethered binds which make the erstwhile dream an actualized really. 

Lemme know.

See that's totally reasonable. The only reason I responded the way I did was because I've been going through this limbo where chaotic emotion has jumbled up functional pragmatics to such a degree that I've come close to losing all patience. It's not my best self - kind of my latest manifestation of irrational assholery - but a product of the time. 

You're right. I'm sure that once things in my own life are in better order that I'll stop being so existentially dictatorial.

I'll give it a second listen. 

And I mean it. I have control issues. I tend to dive headfirst into everything in an effort to take command of a situation before it takes command of me. It's a response to stuff I've been through, but I've lost out on a lot of life that way. I think that just the idea that I could have help - that I wouldn't have to be drowning in a thousand things I'm not sure I have the strength or aptitude to handle...it'd let me be a little more human. And that could be a good thing. 

Looking forward to what you come up with. Hope you have a good shift :)

I think that maybe if I just had some fucking help for once that I wouldn't be going around referring to making love as 'recreational workshop'. 

I thought I was broken. I have this way of systemizing everything, including people and relationships. I'd more or less settled on the notion that I was just like that. But I think the truth is more that my life has been harder than I've given myself or it credit for.

That's very good news.

Balance out the respective health risks of cats and staying at the Marriott for too long? 

Maybe I can come with you one of the days and meet your sister - I can cook something!

P.p.s. It would be weird if we went both nervous and uncomfortable. Like, it would be indicative of a compromised mental state or some serious lapse in judgement.

Also, it's important to admit when you're wrong - even if that does mean giving up the scaffolding that's held up the maladaptive ego you've spent a lifetime dependent on for lack of a novel alternative.

And I'm pretty sure there is no God, so it's you or the Marriott ghosts.

Last week I threw her wheelchair into the parking lot and kicked it. And the other day I left her outside without a room key. 

People say it's hard being a caregiver, but I'm a special kind of bad on that front. I'm trying to do better because that's what she deserves.

I'd never physically hurt anybody and I go out of my way not to emotionally hurt anybody, but I have a wicked temper and short patience. It's the thing that bothers me the most about myself. 

Message sent - 12/19/2020 9:22:34 PM - (SMS)
I can't even imagine. I'm on good terms with my family, but I've never felt much of a connection. If you want to feel a bit better about yourself, my mom had a brain tumor and had to have surgery when I was in high school and it barely phased me. I would hope that I would do the right thing if it came to that in the future, but it would also probably be extraordinarily difficult. 

Message sent - 12/19/2020 9:28:03 PM - (SMS)
I think I've grown to have more sympathy towards my mom over the years... Also, sick and aging Americans are particularly difficult. As my family would say, Americans do not know how to "chi ku" - to "eat bitterness." Too much prosperity and decadence. Sorry, I'm just spinning my wheels. Family is not something I'm particularly good at. 

Message sent - 12/19/2020 9:36:37 PM - (SMS)
Rather - I don't have much experience dealing with difficult family matters, mostly just passively witnessing it. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 9:41:54 PM - (MMS)
I appreciate the sympathy - I've gotten a lot of it. And most people who know me know that Mom is a picky and controlling pain in the ass. But I love her, and when you love somebody you should treat them right - and I don't always do. Caring for her - and failing in caring for her - has revealed a lot to me about my own weaknesses. I can't the situation and I can't change her - but I can try and learn from the situation and do better myself. That's all I can do, really. I tried for a long time riding the waves of other people's insistence that I was this great person in a tough situation, but focusing on that didn't get me very far and only served to make me feel like a defensive monster. 

Most people don't deal well with family stuff - that's why those with any sense outsource that shit to professionals or otherwise leave the infirmed to their own devices. 

Which is totally what I would have done - except I have no control over my own affairs much less hers - so I've had to dig in deep. 

I think it will have been worth it to have had to come face to face with the weakest parts of myself and try to overcome them - even if I fail. But it's hard. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 9:47:15 PM - (MMS)
Dad was like you - that's why he said "take care of Mom" and bailed. I don't mean that to disparage the guy - he was genuinely a great guy and did his best to provide for her and us the best way he knew how. But he assumed that somehow I would be any better at it than he was. It wasn't until the end that he admitted to me that he knew what I was like and basically left me in a position that set me up for failure. He apologized and said that he wished he'd done more to help. I told him that I understood - I'd have done the same thing in his position. 

Just turned out that wasn't my position. So I'm trying to make good on the one I find myself in. I think it's the only way I'll be able to walk away from several difficult years without feeling like it was all for naught.

Does your mom like any particular kind of flowers?

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 9:55:48 PM - (SMS)
The thing is that nobody's good at this sort of thing. It's not even cultural, it's just human. Nobody on earth would be masochistic enough to sign up for the role of caregiver to a mentally and physically ailing family member, and most would do anything they could to get out of it. And I tried. And it didn't work. So now I'm here. And I'm trying to make that work.

Mom likes all flowers. Mostly she just likes getting flowers. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/19/2020 10:00:56 PM - (SMS)
And she's not even all that picky and demanding. It's just really irritating to have somebody needing stuff from you all the time so it seems that way. She's actually pretty stoic and happy to take whatever she can get. And I'm kind of an asshole.

Let's talk tomorrow - I've dumped a lot of thoughts and my brain needs diffuse processing time. 

It's really nice of you to bring flowers. And you're not bad at texting - I'm just freakishly good so you seem bad in comparison. It's my one savant level skill and not to be interpreted as a baseline for much of anything else.

Yeah, texting is just way easier for me - not that I don't like talking to people (okay, usually I don't like talking to people but I like talking to people I know and like) - but when I talk I have to actually put conscious thought into what words are whereas when I text it's mostly entirely preconscious - like a straight data transfer from my brain onto the stream. Gets me in trouble sometimes, but it's also very efficient.

Oh, I thought this earlier but forgot to text you. I've never actively decided that I wanted to be with someone for as long as possible, if not until the end.

Yeah, it's a doorstop - I half read it because people kept telling me to because of my weird Robert Moses thing. It's a controversial book - a later, post-9/11 school of thought within urban studies re-evaluated his legacy with a less cynical tone (and my God!

She says I need a tether - which is absolutely true. At least until I find a constructive outlet for my temperament. Kathleen's been working on me too. She was a lot like me until she got to DARPA and met Steve and they started DataBuey. They're doing well but not as well as they could. That company could be a household name but she almost never does press and does it poorly when she tries. Nobody ever taught her the affect thing.

Dad's problem was that he discovered the affect thing and then abused it - he used it as a tool to bullshit and coast his way through life. That's not to say he was a bad person - quite the contrary - but when that priest said that his soul was in purgatory? I think that's fair.

Good idea with the chess videos. My final thought re: self-awareness. Hypomania? Yeah, probably. I'll make the best of it - the melancholy will come again soon enough (mood stabilizers never worked on me). What I have managed to achieve in increments over the years is a consistency in values and overarching sentiments that have the integrity to withstand fluctuations in mood. I think that's really important and one of the keys to a life well lived as a certain kind of person. That and taking care of mom - whatever that means. 

Goodnight.

Oooh, here's one more though - since I've been compulsively transparent about the nuances of my bizarre psyche. 

I have a tendency to regress. It's not like a trauma response or anything, just a part of my personality - throws people for a loop sometimes. This one guy I was with picked up on that particular tendency, and was way too into it. Like, he took that ball and ran with it way too far. I mean, I appreciate some nurturing, and it's true that now and again I could well benefit from some firm yet loving discipline - but I'm not actually eight years old. Clearly. He reduced my entire personality down to this one thing and fetishized it ("no, I'm not calling you daddy - I didn't even call my own father daddy and he was my father!") 

Yeah, I dumped him. 

Never forget, Aaron, I am large and I contain multitudes.

You are a very sweet man (or just a highly motivated one - it's all relative). I've got an errand or two to run so maybe we can see about finding a service station later. 

For now I just finished fixing Mom's lunch and I'm going up to your room (649, I think?) to have a too-early glass on wine and decompress. You can just meet me there if you'd like. 

Mom's really been angling to get out of the room, so maybe she can today and you can get a chance to meet her.

Your friend Jacob is a good friend. He gave you the same advice I'd have given in his position. I think, though, what what he fails to understand and what you yourself- on some level - fail to understand - is that you can afford a gamble. You can afford to gamble with your heart, with your life, with your future. 

I can't. I can't afford a 'wait and see' - not now, not at this point in my life.  I can't afford another variable. 

Mom's starting to get sick again. I don't know what I'm going to have to deal with. It's been wonderful the time I've known you, but it's not recklessness in me that was demanding of a commitment. But I know it was an irrational demand. It was an irrational demand for you and the only rational recourse for me. 

We're coming from two very different places right now. 

I'd like to be able to say goodbye on good terms. We have a night here, and things should hold well enough for now. But I can't do this. As much as I'd like to I can't afford it.

The character of Stephen Daedalus in Ulysses and "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" was named for the figure Daedalus in Greek mythology (I told you - I know Greek mythology - it's one of my things I know). He flew too close to the sun.

Which, in Ulysses (structured around Homer's Oddyssey) more or less translated to an alltogether too smart and too sensitive of a man having a bad day. But haven't we all been there?

Hitchens was a drunken jackass - I wound up with one particularly bad boyfriend in college because we were both into Hitchens. 

But "Letters to a Young Contrarian" is a primer for a certain kind of person, and "Mortality" helped me through a dark time. 

Man was good with the style points.

That's because they're either a series of obscure culture gestures or some kind of intuitive in-joke thing. But so is basically all language, so...

I was texting Todd (he never answers me but I check my read receipts and he listens). I told him to ask Michelle to marry him. They're been together for 8 years and he's basically raised her son. She's a Psych nurse at Hopkins, and he drives up there once or twice a week, reliably. But he won't make a commitment and keeps on screwing these bikini models.

The whole idea of want and need is such an interesting question. Digging back into my archives I had these parallel statements that were nothing more than deep pulls from my subconscious at the time, but which make a lot of sense to me now:

"I need to fuck you at the Marriott, specifically, in order to save the friendship"
"I want to have sex at home with a person that I talk to on the telephone"

...I went like a whole year, just texting without any concern or awareness of what I was saying. I think it made me a great writer. 

Also...I wasn't wrong. 

Goodnight. I love you.

Good morning. I just texted you a novel. It's not that important. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/23/2020 9:54:29 AM - (MMS)
 I remember when I was in the state psych facility (still don't know why they put me there, I had good insurance) there was this kid Edwin (I say kid, he was maybe 22/23). He was the standout problem patient. He didn't talk but a couple of words and he was constantly doing inappropriate things, like walking into other people's rooms and taking stuff, writing on walls - in the middle of a group session he'd just get up and go over to the window and start drawing things into the air with his finger. He was second only to me in his prolific use of "the quiet room". 

Obviously the staff couldn't disclose anything but the general consensus with the patients was that he was schizophrenic. I didn't think so. What actually stood out to me was that we was really well dressed. Like - air Jordan's (laces removed) and designer jeans - not the kind of presentation you expect from the lowest of society. It was really obvious that somebody cared about this guy and that whoever it was most have been doing pretty well for themselves. 

Edwin took to me - he'd follow me around everywhere. I'd be on the phone with my mom and he'd show up a half-inch behind me and I'd be like "oh, Edwin's here" - and she'd say "tell him I said "hi, Edwin". 

At first the staff treated this like a huge problem - but I said I didn't mind (and there were a couple other guys I absolutely did mind and well made that know). They ended up letting it slide because nobody else knew how to deal with Edwin and I made things a lot easier for them. 

Eventually he got a handle on a pen and some paper and started writing me notes. They were...shockingly coherent. He talked about how he'd been stuck there and was scared and really wanted to go home. I asked him if he felt like all of this was just a big misunderstanding and he gave me an emphatic 'yes'. 

Before I left I made my case to the staff there about the mystery that was Edwin, and suggested they let him write things down and share that. It was all I could do. I'm hoping they listened to me. I'm somewhat optimistic that they did, because nobody knew what the hell to do about Edwin. 

Anyway....just something I was thinking about this morning.

I was texting her about you and she she was like..."yeah, you're dad did that - yeah, I know what you're talking about" - I think that means you have her approval....with fondness...in spite of yourself. Which really, I think, is the best kind of approval.

Don't say that I'm not going to irritate, annoy, upset, hurt and sometimes even generally bore you - say that it'll never be a dealbreaker for you when I do. Because I'm really not some character in a movie that you feel you're supposed to like. I'm a person - bad as I am at accepting that. And nothing helps more than the rare security that comes in knowing that's okay in somebody's book. 

I promise to always return the favor.

Just needed to clarify - I have a way of settling the bar too high for myself and winding up a disappointment. 

Mom says she doesn't really want to move to Florida either. It was home once but it stopped being that a long time ago. She just doesn't know what else to do with herself. 

It's just...information. 

Also, because of her income status she'd be eligible for Medicaid in states where that's a thing (not Florida) so it'd be easy to afford a CNA, where it's looking exorbitantly expensive in Florida for that contingency alone. Fucking Republicans. 

We're trying to work through the logistics - she knows that what I'm doing for her isn't sustainable and she feels terrible about it. 

I'm still sufficiently prideful in my independence that I'm focusing on trying to make it work anyway.

Message received from Caitlyn - 12/23/2020 11:54:01 AM - (MMS)
It's all pros and cons. On one hand...no state taxes - low property taxes. That's good. That helps. But goddamn are CNA's expensive, even with decent private insurance - you have to buy supplemental insurance - and by the time you've covered that you've broken even if you're lucky. Florida was offered federal funding for Medicaid expansion just like everybody else...but they said 'no'. 

Is it any wonder they have a problem with meth gators? 

Seriously, though - if you want to have a good time, follow Florida Man on Twitter. You think China's weird? 

...that too comes mostly down to state laws. Florida has this thing where all police reports are immediately public record, so bored journalists eat up the crazy stories. 

When mom was working for the Daytona Beach police department part of her job was to prepare the reports for the journalists to pursue every morning.

I think she'd really appreciate that. I think Olga's going to be in the first batch too because of her job. I think it's probably fine so long as she's not the sort to frequent underground mosh pits. 

Right now I think the biggest issue is mom not feeling well physically. I was planning on helping her with a bath and to get spiffied for going out tomorrow but she doesn't know if she's up to it. She says there's what she'd like to do and what she can do. She's trying to keep me calm, really. 

Angela's back in town and she's coming over tomorrow so I think that will help us both, and she'll be a good person to talk to about the reality of mom's illness and physical limitations - we've been needing to have a 'let's get real' conversation for a while and Angela brings the wisdom and the safe space. 

Now there's a person you'd enjoy meeting. She had a theology PhD but basically just ministers as a hobby. She's been in 27 car accidents - I told her that I thought she took the whole notion of 'Jesus take the wheel' a little too literally. 

...I'm imagining the world's best dinner party.

My dad was really good at sports - particularly tennis - but he was embarrassingly mediocre at basketball, despite being 6'3". He had an armature basketball league with some of his friends for a while but it never panned out. 

I still liked going to those games a lot more than I did his softball tournaments. It's nice being indoors.

I do genuinely wonder/worry about the whole 'seeing shadows' thing. You can concoct whatever story you want to explain it, but something is going on in the brain. 

It's not schizophrenia - I know schizophrenia. But it's something, and it's something I've experienced myself closely enough to be concerned. 

Regardless, Angela will be welcomed company.

I kind of think that. It's just sucked because I've been the only one there to try and make it happen, and I haven't been doing so well myself. For now, it seems to be enough that I'm here.

Hmmm. You know? I've been thinking/worried that I was going crazy or developing a personality disorder or maybe this  whole thing was some kind of maladaptive delusion and soon enough the rug will be pulled out from under me and I'll be left with nothing but the stark reality of the dangers of pursuing the course of my own madness. 

I think more reasonably it's that I'm a human, and that I'm not particularly comfortable with that. 

Under any other circumstances you'd have been a person I'd have harbored a crush on for years on end and nothing more. The extreme stress I've been under has broken me down - I don't have the strength to hold up all the walls I've built around myself. 

And for all that I'm absolutely terrified of the possible implications of that? It's occurred to me that there's still a non-zero chance that's a good thing. Maybe even the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

...I can't wait for it to be a year from now. I want my routine back.

Honestly? It'd be a massive relief if that were true because, just...loving you with all my heart is so healing for me right now, and I'd hate to think it meant there was something wrong with me. 

And even if that were the case, I don't know what it is I'd be expected to do about it - go back to the psych ward, I guess. I'd actually been considering options for long-term institutionalization - group homes, assisted-living type situations...for the terminally pathological, you know?

That's not to say these things don't matter - of course they do. It's only that there's so much nuance to truth of the story of any given life. That's the thing the woke people miss when they insist on these broad-sweeping statements. It's not that they're wrong, necessarily - just that the rigid narrative they adhere to doesn't leave much room for the kind of intricacies and confounding variables that often enough make the most difference.

Talked to Olga. She's hanging in there. I told her way too much about you and she's really happy for me. We were totally toxic together but she's still my best friend and I was hating the idea of being so far away.  I think you guys would really like each other. She's crazy, but it's a superficial, mental-illness kind of crazy - her foundation is very grounded. And you'd be a good example to her of the kind of guy she should expect for herself (this is Olga we're talking about here - we know where the bar is set). 

I think the most surprising thing in the world is going to happen and everything is going to be okay. It's a vague intuition and there's a lot of evidence to the contrary, but sometimes you make the best bets just by throwing your finger up into the air and feeling how the wind blows.

Never did tell you much about Mary - my dad's older sister. She the nice one, but she completely can't function. She's an artist - does mostly pottery and ceramics. I have no idea what would have happened to her if she hadn't met Kevin. Kevin's a pilot for American. They were absolutely wonderful to me when I had my breakdown - flew me up to Stowe and then flew back down with me just to drive my car back to the house so I wouldn't have to deal with it. 

I'll wind up like Kathleen before I let myself wind up like Mary. But she's a really good person.

You should know, by the way, that I didn't just go run away to hide in the corner (I mean, yeah, I tried to - but you talked me out of it - thanks for that by the way). As much as I need support right now it's important to me that you can come to know me as a person who can be relied on to navigate difficult situations with a relatively level head. Because for some unfathomable reason I really want to be able to think that whatever it is we've been cooking up is something that could be sustainable and maybe even actually good.

Just a bit of a sad but important thought - my dad's last words to my mom (and apparently he crying ugly tears) were "why won't you believe me when I tell you that I love you?". 

I'm not sure, specifically, what to do with that information - but it's something I'll never forget. And I think not forgetting will come to be important someday.

One of her first impressions of him was that she'd never known that a person could drink that much and not die. He drank White Russians out of flower vases - literally.

Looking forward to it. Texting with Olga - her sister Valia just graduated - Communication's Degree...which is weird because I maybe heard her speak twice. She was the president of the Korean Student Association at Mason - which is weird because she's Ukrainian - but she got into K-Pop one day and...just kept going with it. 

I think she's going on to good things. I'm hoping the two of them can reconcile - they were really close before the chaos happened. 

Christmas is a bitch for thinking about interpersonal regrets. 

Anyway...

I told her it was a bad idea to move in with Babushka - emotional support is fantastic but it wears on the relationships to be the primary caregiver to somebody with serious mental and physical health problems - even if you do have the credentials. 

I think more than anything that's how she ended up living in that van. As she likes to say "the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry". 

I like your idea of New Year's as being a thing. I don't think I can believe in the spirit of Christmas anymore - but New Year's has some potential.

Good talking to you. I just want you to know that I had no idea the wine was $15 a bottle. Like I'd said - I've never been allowed access to my own finances. I'm in the dark about these things. It's not that I don't care, or that I have some fundamentally warped view of the world - I just don't know, and haven't been in the position to. I hope you can always feel comfortable telling me if and when there's a problem. The last thing I'd want is to cause stress or make bad choices purely from a place of ignorance or naitivity. I promise that when we get together next I'll be as mindful as I can. I know these things are important.

Enjoy your holiday. Look forward to seeing you soon.

How bout this? You're well in your right to say "hey guys - hope you have a good time, but I've been working for hours and I'm really burned out. I'm going to duck out and probably head to bed early. Hope you have a good time." or something like that.

I honestly thought it would be interesting to talk about work stuff in a more relaxed setting, but I guess as I often do I overestimate people's capacity for trust and doing something offbeat.

Sometimes - I can be a good source. How I came by that particular book was more of a journey. 

I don't know the key code for my house so I usually just break in these days through the dog door when I lock the door from the inside. 

That's been a big problem with the house- dad was trying to install a dog door and wound up just taking a saw-zaw and cutting a whole in the side of the house (he was bad at these things too). Birds fly in and nest in the laundry room in the winter. 

...but the new owners don't need to know that.

Will listen. I need a regrouper anyway. Things went south with mom at the hospital - this chaos has seriously strained our relationship and has brought out the worst in us both.

He'd have liked you - he'd have debated you on the merits of Hong Kong. He lived in Guangzhou for about a year a couple years ago and he thought it was the best place in China. I never got a chance to visit because of school and mom - but I wish I had.

I started talking to Mom about him and his weird ally ship with this guy Muhammad - he was the one who went after the women. Eventually she totally wigged and pulled my goalie for me.

I was thinking this morning about a really good sign for us. 

That thing about your parents not knowing I live here? That could have been a massive fight. Something like that with Olga (her trying to sneak me into her house without her parents knowing and that upsetting me over and over) was a massive fight. But instead I told you how I felt and why and you listened and understood and we're moving forward. 

I don't think either of us are as bad at relationships as we've come to believe. I think there just aren't enough nice people in the world who can explain things in a way that makes sense. 

I love you more and more everyday. Seeing you in bed with the sun rising over the river, in what I hope to be our home - was one of the most beautiful things or moments I've ever seen or experienced. It really does feel like something good has finally started to transcend upon my soul after a very dark night. 

You were always a very good person. This life and this world is just difficult. I look forward to a lifetime with you, working through all that by your side. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 1/7/2021 7:41:31 AM - (SMS)
It's terrifying to admit to myself that this could all be real. Because for it to be real means it's something I could lose. 

But I want it to be real. I want this to be our home that we share and that we build a life in. I want to bring in my stuff and put it on the walls and start seriously joining our lives together. 

I love you so much, I've crossed the event horizon and I'll never be okay again without you.

I did this - I lived by this - and the thing is that I almost died. I got so sick and was having seizures and I weighed 90 lbs. My family and friends were completely beside themselves.

Oh no! Slow can be worse than fast! 

Yeah - I thought I was dying for like a few hours but I'm pretty sure I'll be fine in a day or so now. 

Talked to my Mom for like a half-hour - touting your virtues and talking about how we're working through our relationship. She thinks we definitely needed to find each other, but that we're going to be okay. So that's good.

She's still kind of freaked out about how quickly everything has moved - but so long as we keep working things out day by day she's comfortable and happy that I have someone good in my life right now and deeply grateful for your family and their support and embrace of me - because she didn't get that from my dad's family and it was really hard on her.

I do think we need to be the couple who indulges each other, and opens space for each other. We both deal so much with internalized pressure - if anything would ever destroy is it would be if we externalized that onto each other. Rather we need to  work empathetically to be supportive and unconditional respites for one another. If we do that, I think we can find some manner of trust and assurance in our mutual conscientiousness and commitment to building together a life well-lived.

Yep. One other thing that was red-flagged talking to your mom was that I indicated that my family was concerned about the relationship- I said it was because of the pacing of letting folks know - it's mostly that my mom knows I'm holed up in a house in Baltimore with some guy I met off the internet and spending a lot of money at liquor stores. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 1/18/2021 6:23:24 AM - (SMS)
I think mostly it's the names of the liquor stores that have her freaked out. She knows how much I drink. She knows my spending habits. It's just the Maryland aesthetics.

Sometimes the answer is "yes, bottle it up and don't say anything" - because you don't have to. You know and they know and you know they know. Empathy comes with mutual understanding of mutual struggle, compassion comes with the act of devoting love to that understanding. Our life that we may make together may be great, but only if we take the approach of trust, empathy and compassion. We're not the kind of people who need to challenge each other - we do that enough to ourselves. We need to be dedicated helpers and respites for one another in a world altogether too harsh. If we can do that - we can do anything. 

Thank you for all your kindness and all you've done for me. I love you with all my heart.

Had a momentary lull and I've thought about this: I agreed with you and my mom that the details of our relationship were between us. But I think that goes both ways. My relationship with finances and my family are between me and my family. So long as I'm buying groceries, paying half the rent, paying for my own phone and my own car and everything else - it's none of your business how I go about it and it's not your place to judge me for the relationship I have with my family. I've always been more than fair to you about these things - it's not right for you to project your own baggage and anxiety onto me. I'm living my life the way I need to - not the way you think is best. That's not independence, that's my being controlled by you. And that's not okay with me.

Ashley says you could probably just add me to the insurance as an 'authorized driver' rather than a primary driver of the car and the added cost would be much less - especially if I'm not using the car much.

Inappropriate thought (yet constructive) - I think I should consider going back on birth control. Our abortion experiment idea is compelling but probably too dark for our sensibilities in practice. And troubleshooting the come-leaking problem - I'm thinking that putting a tampon in and then taking out after a few minutes might work in preventing leakage. Worth a shot.

I'm a lot more moderate - I like the security that comes with knowing I'm going to stay in a place or situation for a while - I don't like that 'permanently on the move' feeling to life - I find that stressful. I like to have a home base. But I like the idea of periodic change for the sake of growth. My mom has always frustrated me about that issue, and my dad always frustrated me because he was so constantly fleeing something. I want balance. I want to be able to be here for a while and establish a proper home, and feel comfortable there, and then move on when it's time.

I'm thinking about 'No Children' and the line "And I hope if I had the strength to walk out, you'd stay the hell out of my way".  

Genuinely, I hope that by the time we walk down the isle together, that song will be an ironic encapsulation of every bullet we ever dodged and every one that we will dodge. 

Because I'm still in love with you. And I can't wait to see you dance again. 

Trust takes time. We fell into domesticity so quickly that it's easy to forget that we're still getting to know each other. But I'm cautiously optimistic. If I was a gambler, I'd bet money on us. And I know you would too. And that's why.

Dear Aaron,

You made a very valid point about my inconsistency in my characterization of my relationship with my mother, and its relationship to my particular level of disability and mental health problems. It's absurdly complicated. 

Joan Didion once said "I write so that I know what I think" - I think that applies here on a pretty profound level. It'll take me some time to sort through and root out the nuanced truth to everything. For now I think the closest approximation is to say that the truth - whatever it is - is both promising and benevolent. It's an intuition, but intuitions are pretty reliable starting points more often than not. 

Also - life is never a thing we're handed, it's a thing we build, and so much of the potential for quality and durability comes down to the tools we manage to find at our disposal. You're the best thing that's every happened to me because you, my dear, are the Swiss Army knife of men. I plan on taking you with me everywhere I go. 

Love you much. Looking forward to Annapolis tomorrow. 

Sincerely,
Your fiancée - the world's fastest texter.

You really are an extraordinary multipurpose tool for me cognitively. 

First you finished my book, then you helped me understand what a "nice person who explains things in a way that makes sense" actually means (
(I'd started saying it to Todd years ago - I emphasized that whatever I meant by that was to some degree profoundly significant - but he didn't know what I meant and I basically didn't know either) 

I said a lot of things around that time that had a strong intuitive weight and accuracy but no clear discernible meaning in any traditional sense. What I'm looking forward to the most is the day I finally crack the code to "everything in the daytime" - because whatever the hell that is I know it's the ultimate. And I'm so confident now, Aaron. We're totally going to everything in the daytime - it's going to be so great. 

I love you. Thanks for being my companion for what was probably the best vacation I've ever taken in my life.

Relevant to the question? "No goals" "No goals" had broad spectrum implications in my bullet-journal mapping of the nature and practices of existential perfectionism as both a philosophy and a manner of life. Life altering insight. Couldn't have gotten there without you. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 2/26/2021 1:30:02 PM - (SMS)
Also relevant - deep pull from Nov. 2018 "Sam is going to be the best thing that will ever happen to me in my entire life", followed by January 2019 "there is no god, there is only Sam, and Sam is just an idiot with a mood disorder". 

I think it has something to do with the master/slave dialect. It's a big problem for nice people who explain things in a way that makes sense. But there is a solution. It's just a puzzle. 

...so glad you know now that I'm not actually crazy. Sometimes I just need to brainstorm at somebody in my own weird cognitive shorthand. 

I'll leave you alone now. Have a good rest :)

I had the same problem as you did with your mom. I grew to resent her because the strength of her influence in my life became intrusive when I was trying to focus on solidifying my own life and my own identity and relationships. My developing relationship with you was a perfect example of that. But I realize now that things are different. Because you're no longer the the thing that's getting in the way of my relationship with my mom or Vice verse - you're my partner, and that includes being my partner in helping and taking care of her. It's a radically new dynamic for me. But I think, probably for the first time in my life, that it's a healthy one. 

And so we move one step closer to the the ever elusive but oh-so-compelling goal of existential perfection. 

One day at a time. It's a process.

Almost ready. 

I will tell you - I think you'll find that we're a lot more functionally comparable when I'm properly medicated and not in the grip of some kind of life-altering emotional crisis. 

Probably the most annoying thing you'll find is my inclination to text you what I find to be relevant thoughts rather than directly tell you. But there's an upside there. As you should know by now there's a massive gulf between my thoughts and my capacity to coherently articulate my thoughts. It's probably the autism. I'll try not to overdo it, and should I lapse - there's always the 'mute text' function. 

Getting out of the tub now.

My mom and I are having a very constructive and necessary talk. She was talking about moving back to Gainesville again and I told her how sad I'd be. But I understand why she feels that way. 

I'm facing my own assholery. It's a process. She found a place here over by the wegmans she really likes that about $400 cheaper than the White Marsh place. Ultimately it's probably going to come down to my capacity to put my feelings and opinions aside and actually make a commitment to being consistently decent and compassionate to a person I love.

Message received from Caitlyn - 2/28/2021 12:07:29 PM - (MMS)
Ps 
I was totally dumbfounded that you thought what Ahmet did was worse than what Sarah did. I think I made my point decently and diplomatically but all the while I was restraining a moral rage. 

Ethical choices are evaluated along the axes of intention and consequence. In both cases there's absolutely no comparison. I think it actually wouldn't be too hard for a reasonable, compassionate person to forgive the man. He talked about his issues and his social anxiety. He probably just freaked out and couldn't deal so he bailed for lack of a novel alternative. 

It's so sad that he has to hold that over his own head to the degree that he obviously still does. The fact that he responds to the whole thing with a generous offer of a punch in the face with the simple hope of restoring a friendship? 

I get the impression that he's one of the best people I've ever met. 

It's hard to see great people in the process of destroying themselves. It evokes a kind of nihilistic sadness that captures the tone of a given moment or day and sends it down the dumb-waiter to the underworld. Should you ever find yourself in the position of seeking anything close to an affirmation or embrace of life - it's something close to an existential threat. In our fear, it's really easy to get angry. 

But how much of that fear and frustration are truly and authentically tied to those people we associate it with? How much more is it about our own fear of what we might become? And how much do we lose and how much do we harm in falsely conflating the two? 

The only thing we truly have control of is ourselves. The only thing we have constructive control over is our particular response - day by day, case by case, moment by moment - to who we are and to what is thrown our way. 

...but I'm just preaching to the choir. You're the man who introduced me to the phrase "a series of incremental 'yesses'". 

As we move forward in our lives - let's strive not only to embrace that within ourselves, but to facilitate it in service to others. Personally, I think we've already started. And I love you more than I think I could ever love anything because we fell into that so effortlessly together. 

To will oneself free is to will others free. 

Message received from Caitlyn - 2/28/2021 1:46:03 PM - (MMS)
Dear Aaron,
Always adjacent to 'everything in the daytime' is my mother's perpetual drumbeat - "the truth is benevolent". I'd had many doubts about that. A lifetime of perpetual worry left me feeling that such a premise was a fragile and delicate thing that could be pulled away in a moment's notice, and I've conducted myself in life in accordance with such a belief. 

But I've persisted and persevered through that darkness and anxiety (and my God - how bad it could get sometimes) because beneath that belief was some deeper sense that one way or another everything would somehow work out, and that the person I was and the life I sought would one day come to unfold and prove to me that I was right all along. 

The events of the past few months have served as confirmation of that. 

I know that you struggle with the same fears and the same doubts. But as a person with a proven track record, I can assure you that everything is going to be okay. 

You're not going to be an alcoholic. You're going to finish your masters and find yourself a solid job that challenges you and affords you both stability and satisfaction. 

You will accomplish things that bring you a manner of acclaim, but more significantly you will achieve such acclaim secure in yourself and your intrinsic value to such an extent that you wouldn't need it in the first place. 

You're going to have a happy, healthy and meaningful life, and you're going to have it alongside someone you dearly love, who loves you in return. And you're going to help innumerable others along the way. 

You know? My dad had this thing where he actually believed my mom was psychic. She let him think that because it gave her leverage. But no. She just noticed things and made a rational analysis of the facts, with a bit of wisdom thrown in. 

The sad fact of life is that the truth isn't benevolent for everyone, but it so clearly is for you. So I would suggest that in lieu of worrying and dwelling on the difficulties of it all, you embrace this time and soak in all that had been afforded to you by the simple fact you've somehow managed to navigate the gauntlet of all your previous years to find yourself on the other side, ensconced in light, with a broad and wonderful future lingering just on the horizon. 

As Bukowski wrote "be it peace or happiness, let it enfold you." As for today - it's called a hangover, don't be so traumatized. 

I love you. 

...and I'm still not wrong.

Okay, yeah, I'm totally convinced - you'll have to fight me on this.

I loved you that you were an effeminate drunk with a brilliant mind and way too much time on his hands  - because you reminded me of my dad. You reminded me of home, back when home was a good place to be. 

I suppose you could call that trad-transgressive. 

I have odd complexes (you can't face yogurt - don't be a hypocrite) and odd habits and odd behaviors. I will never be able to function in the world in accordance with all the standard conventions. If forced to abide by standard practices and evaluated by common standards, I will fail. And if my failure comes with some sort of moral weight I hadn't accounted for...let's just say I've been in some very dark places in my life. 

Ethics are an extremely subjective thing, and they rely heavily on context. 

One of the challenges we face having known each other for such a short period of time is that neither of us have the full context of each other and of each other's lives. 

That's one of the reason that it'll be good to spend some time getting a better portrait of each other before moving forward in building a life together. But that's not because it's in any way a matter of vetting - not at this point. I think we're both locked in. But in order to be successful it's essential that we take an approach that is inquisitive rather than mandated. I appreciate so much and am still here today because you seem to understand that. 

You seem to understand that many of our superficial similarities mask very different underlying issues and dynamics. I think that's a good thing, because it means we can learn from each other and help each other in unique ways while tackling the same problems. I can help you be less impulsive and prone towards excess for its own sake. You can me become less anxious and more confident in my role in the world. We've already done that in a lot of ways, and our lives have improved as a result. 

Your proposal and my acceptance was the product of a massive leap of faith. I hope that as we move forward that such a faith persists, and translates towards specific matters - even those we can't initially seem to understand. What matters more than your conceptualization of parental-fiscal dynamics and their relationship to substance abuse is your belief in me as being a fundamentally ethical person. And that's just one of many examples. 

It's a steep leaning curve. But I think it'll be worth it.

Looking through your mom's binder. This could actually be really helpful for us. We should look through it and some some things a shot.

Okay so...I've been giving this issue a bit more thought and I think it's time for us both to get serious in addressing our drinking. Your hangover from hell and my shitty drunk comments to Mom are serious signs that things need to chance and that we need to make a deliberate effort for them to change. 

I'm confident we can pull it off - it's legitimately not a difficult as quitting smoking. 

I'd been mulling over different possible techniques and trying to concoct a couple of different approaches we can take. 

I think your 'no drinking and driving' as a hard rule is a good one. 

From there? I think we should take the big step of limiting ourselves to one shared bottle of wine in the evening as a general practice. I think we can manage that. I've come to find that our shared evenings are usually defined more by conversation and companionship than they are by alcohol anyway. There are movies to watch, records to play, and sex to be had. It might be a kind of weird transition, but I'm in if you are, and honestly I think we'd adapt and even grow to like it soon enough. 

Of course there's still the issue of my day drinking. For that I think what I need to most is something engaging for me to throw myself into. It's not Python...not now. But I love the thought of being able to spend time putting work into our home to truly make it ours. I'm going to ask mom for a loan for some upfront costs. Hopefully if I frame it as a novel alternative to drinking she might agree. 

Make tweaks, make a home, be in love, progress.

And in the spirit of 'pulling the trigger' on things? I say we start tonight. 

I approach mom about the projects sometime today. That and have a broader conversation about the issue.

Sounds good to me.

You there?

Your mom is worried and I'm getting worried. What's going on?

Starting to head back now - should be about 2 1/2 hours
